# Colorblind

Helps colorblind players by adding outlines to enemies and traps, configurable.

# Configuration

- Open the config in R2Modman and change the outline configuration for each biome. Default is used in case something goes wrong and in places like chaos realm. You can change the RGB values, opacity, thickness and threshold.

- You can also disable traps and miscellaneous, and enable speedrun mode. Speedrun mode is mandatory for leaderboard runs and overrides the first two options.
